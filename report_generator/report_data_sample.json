        "detailed_report": "The workshop commenced at 10:00 AM with an inaugural address by the Head of Department, followed by a brief introduction of the resource person, Dr. Lorem Ipsum, by the Faculty Coordinator Prof. John Doe.\n\nThe first half of the session focused on foundational concepts of Artificial Intelligence, including machine learning pipelines, neural network architectures, and natural language processing. Dr. Ipsum illustrated each concept with real-world case studies from industry deployments.\n\nAfter a short lunch break, the session transitioned into hands-on demonstrations. Students were guided through a live coding exercise building a basic image classification model. The final hour was reserved for an open Q&A, where participants engaged actively with the speaker on topics ranging from AI ethics to career pathways in data science.",
